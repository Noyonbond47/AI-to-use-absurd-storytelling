# Case Study: Testing Narrative Coherence in an Absurdist World

This repository contains the documentation for "Everybody Hates Ethan," a research project designed to test the capabilities of a Large Language Model (DeepSeek AI) in generating a coherent, chapter-based story within a deliberately chaotic and absurdist world.

The primary goal was to analyze how the AI would handle a "zero-to-one-hundred" plot escalation model, similar to modern adult cartoons, and whether it could maintain character consistency amidst relentless, nonsensical events. This project moves beyond traditional narrative structures to explore the AI's performance under conditions of extreme creative chaos.

### Core Research Questions

* How effectively can an AI maintain a consistent narrative thread when tasked with escalating a normal situation into an absurd one?
* What are the primary failure points (e.g., repetition, plot inconsistency) when using an AI for high-concept, slapstick comedy writing?
* Can an AI successfully replicate a specific, established comedic voice and tone (e.g., Chris Rock-style narration)?

### Skills Demonstrated

* **Comedic Narrative Design:** Architecting a multi-chapter plot based on the principles of absurdist humor and escalating chaos.
* **AI Capability Analysis:** Documenting and analyzing the performance of an AI on a non-traditional, chaotic creative task.
* **Tonal & Voice Replication:** Engineering prompts to guide the AI toward a specific, well-known comedic and narrative style.
* **World-Building Under Chaos:** Creating and maintaining a set of "rules" for an intentionally illogical world.

### A Note on Methodology and Evidence

The attached `case_study.md` provides a high-level analysis and summary of the key challenges and successes encountered during this project.

The **`Raw Chat Thread.pdf`** file serves as the primary evidence for this analysis. It is the complete, unedited log of the entire prompting session. For a granular, moment-to-moment view of the AI's specific errors (like repetitive narration or plot deviations) and my corrective prompts, please refer directly to this file. This approach was chosen to maintain the authenticity of the research log and to provide full transparency into the iterative process.
